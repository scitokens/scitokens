SciTokens Library
=================

This library aims to be a reference implementation of the SciTokens'
JSON Web Token (JWT) token format.

SciTokens is built on top of the
`PyJWT <https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt>`__ and
`cryptography <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>`__ libraries. We aim
to provide a safe, high-level interface for token manipulation, avoiding
common pitfalls of using the underling libraries directly.

*NOTE*: SciTokens (the format and this library) is currently being
designed; this README describes how we would like it to work, not
necessarily current functionality. Particularly, we do not foresee the
chained tokens described here as part of the first release's
functionality. The ideas behind the separate ``Validator`` in this
library is taken from
`libmacaroons <https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons>`__.

Generating Tokens
-----------------

Usage revolves around the ``SciToken`` object. This can be generated
directly:

::

    >>> import scitokens
    >>> token = scitokens.SciToken() # Create token and generate a new private key
    >>> token2 = scitokens.SciToken(key=private_key) # Create token using existing key

where ``key`` is a private key object (more later on generating private
keys). Direct generation using a private key will most often be done to
do a *base token*. SciTokens can be chained, meaning one token can be
appended to another:

::

    >>> token = scitokens.SciToken(parent=parent_token)

The generated object, ``token``, will default to having all the
authoriations of the parent token - but is mutable and can add further
restrictions.

Tokens contain zero or more claims, which are facts about the token that
typically indicate some sort of authorization the bearer of the token
has. A token has a list of key-value pairs; each token can only have a
single value per key, but multiple values per key can occur in a token
chain.

To set a claim, one can use dictionary-like setter:

::

    >>> token['claim1'] = 'value2'

The value of each claim should be a Python object that can be serialized
to JSON.

Token Serialization
-------------------

Parent tokens are typically generated by a separate server and sent as a
response to a successful authentication or authorization request.
SciTokens are built on top of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which define a
useful base64-encoded serialization format. A serialized token may look
something like this:

::

    eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImN3ayI6eyJ5IjoiazRlM1FFeDVjdGJsWmNrVkhINlkzSFZoTzFadUxVVWNZQW5ON0xkREV3YyIsIngiOiI4TkU2ZEE2T1g4NHBybHZEaDZUX3kwcWJOYmc5a2xWc2pYQnJnSkw5aElBIiwiY3J2IjoiUC0yNTYiLCJrdHkiOiJFQyJ9LCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ4NXUiOiJodHRwczovL3ZvLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tL0pXUyJ9.eyJyZWFkIjoiL2xpZ28ifQ.uXVzbcOBCK4S4W89HzlWNmnE9ZcpuRHKTrTXYv8LZL9cDy3Injf97xNPm756fKcYwBO5KykYngFrUSGa4owglA.eyJjcnYiOiAiUC0yNTYiLCAia3R5IjogIkVDIiwgImQiOiAieWVUTTdsVXk5bGJEX2hnLVVjaGp0aXZFWHZxSWxoelJQVEVaZDBaNFBpOCJ9

This is actually 4 separate base64-encoded strings, separated by the
``.`` character. The four pieces are:

-  A *header*, implementing the JSON Web Key standard, specifying the
   cryptographic properties of the token.
-  A *payload*, specifying the claims (key-value pairs) encoded by the
   token and asserted by the VO.
-  A *signature* of the header and payload, ensuring authenticity of the
   payload.
-  A *key*, utilized to sign any derived tokens. The key is an optional
   part of the token format, but may be required by some remote
   services.

Given a serialized token, the ``scitokens`` library can deserialize it:

::

    >>> token = scitokens.SciToken.deserialize(token_serialized_bytes)

As part of the deserialization, the ``scitokens`` library will throw an
exception if token verification failed.

The existing token can be serialized with the ``serialize`` method:

::

    >>> token_serialized_bytes = token.serialize()

Validating Tokens
-----------------

In SciTokens, we try to distinguish between *validating* and *verifying*
tokings. Here, verification refers to determining the integrity and
authenticity of the token: can we validate the token came from a known
source without tampering? Can we validate the chain of trust? Validation
is determining whether the claims of the token are satisfied in a given
context.

For example, if a token contains the claims
``{vo: ligo, op: read, path: /ligo}``, we would first verify that the
token is correctly signed by a known public key associated with LIGO.
When presented to a storage system along with an HTTP request, the
storage system would validate the token authorizes the corresponding
request (is it a GET request? Is it for a sub-path of /ligo?).

Within the ``scitokens`` module, validation is done by the ``Validator``
object:

::

    >>> val = scitokens.Validator()

This object can be reused for multiple validations. All SciToken claims
must be validated. There are no "optional" claim attributes or values.

To validate a specific claim, provide a callback function to the
``Validator`` object:

::

    >>> def validate_op(value):
    ...     return value == True
    >>> val.add_validator("op", validate_op)

Once all the known validator callbacks have been registered, use the
``validate`` method with a token:

::

    >>> val.validate(token)

This will throw a ``ValidationException`` if the token could not be
validated.
